## My process

First, I create the basic structure using HTML. Then, I proceed to classify each item that needs customization to achieve the required aesthetics in the challenge. Once the classification part is completed, I start building the designs in CSS to attain the specified style. I only move on to the next item once I've achieved the expected result. Finally, I begin configuring the media queries to make everything responsive for different screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Mastering the intricacies of media queries was a challenge I faced. This experience proved invaluable, teaching me not only the mechanics but also how to apply them in practical scenarios. Throughout the development process, I encountered various hurdles that ultimately became learning opportunities. These included refining my workflow organization and ensuring code readability for seamless collaboration with others. These lessons have significantly enhanced my skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, this project marked a milestone as my first solo endeavor. I take great pride in the results I achieved.
